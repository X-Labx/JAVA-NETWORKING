Simple Java packet networking example, which sends packets to and from a server (localhost). 

The packet transmission can be viewed in Wireshark, as the code sends and receives packets to understand what is going on, and in the contents of such packets.

The code can be easily built out to send packets as required using Java to hardware (e.g., FPGAs), distributed programs or remote servers.
